# KITECH.AI.Materials

* This repository contains a lot of materials (i.e., tutorials, articles, wiki, codes, and videos and so on) for my colleges to help understand what machine learning and deep learning are doing to develop artificial intelligence for smart factory and humanoids.
* Even though these materials may be poor in the viewpoint of AI experts, I would like to incrementally improve this repository to build extensive knowledge for my colleges and me.
